# SEED Protocol Enhancement Proposal v2.0
**From**: Session 00010  
**To**: Session 09 & Session 02.13  
**Purpose**: Prevent v5-style "building on assumptions" through staged reality establishment

---

## Current SEED Protocol Limitation

Session 09's SEED protocol assumes **seeds contain complete, consistent reality**. V5 proved this assumption false:
- Seeds contained conflicting visions (gaming vs educational)
- 40+ sessions built elaborate systems for wrong database
- 16,000 lines of code became non-functional due to schema mismatch

## Proposed Enhancement: Reality Establishment Stages

### Stage 0: Vision Anchoring (BEFORE seed parsing)
**Purpose**: Establish immutable foundation truth  
**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Owner**: Current session with user validation

#### Stage 0.1: Vision Reality Check
```bash
# Questions that must have definitive answers:
1. What is the ONE sentence description of this platform?
2. Who are the THREE primary user types?
3. What is the CORE business model?
4. What is the PRIMARY user engagement loop?
5. What database schema exists RIGHT NOW?
```

#### Stage 0.2: Vision Documentation
```markdown
# V6-VISION-ANCHOR.md
## Immutable Foundation
- Platform Identity: [ONE sentence]
- User Trinity: [THREE types with clear roles]
- Business Model: [Revenue + engagement strategy]
- Core Loop: [Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Loop]
- Database Reality: [Current schema status]

## Vision Boundaries
- What we ARE building: [Definitive scope]
- What we are NOT building: [Explicit exclusions]
- Success Definition: [Measurable outcomes]
```

#### Stage 0.3: Schema Reality Verification
```sql
-- MANDATORY before any seed processing
-- Run against ACTUAL database RIGHT NOW
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Document results in V6-DATABASE-REALITY.md
```

### Stage 1: Seed Validation Against Vision (ENHANCED current protocol)
**Purpose**: Ensure seeds align with established reality  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  

#### Stage 1.1: Seed-Vision Compatibility Check
```python
# New validation layer for Task Reality Agent
def validate_seed_against_vision(seed_data, vision_anchor):
    conflicts = []
    
    # Check user types match vision trinity
    seed_users = extract_user_types(seed_data)
    vision_users = vision_anchor['user_trinity']
    if seed_users != vision_users:
        conflicts.append(f"User type mismatch: {seed_users} vs {vision_users}")
    
    # Check business model compatibility
    seed_economy = extract_economy_model(seed_data)
    if not compatible_with_vision(seed_economy, vision_anchor['business_model']):
        conflicts.append("Economy model incompatible with vision")
    
    return conflicts
```

#### Stage 1.2: Conflict Resolution Strategy
**If conflicts found:**
1. **STOP** all seed processing
2. **DOCUMENT** exact conflicts found
3. **DECIDE**: Modify vision OR modify seeds OR reject seeds
4. **UPDATE** vision anchor if modified
5. **RE-VALIDATE** before proceeding

### Stage 2: Selective Extraction Planning (NEW stage)
**Purpose**: Plan exactly what to extract from previous work  
**Duration**: 45 minutes  

#### Stage 2.1: Extraction Requirement Definition
```markdown
# Based on V6-VISION-ANCHOR.md, define:
1. Required frontend components: [Specific list]
2. Required backend logic: [Specific functions]
3. Required database structure: [Specific tables/relationships]
4. Required integration points: [External systems]
```

#### Stage 2.2: Previous Work Assessment Matrix
```python
# For each v5 component:
assessment_matrix = {
    'component_name': {
        'vision_alignment': 0-100,  # How well it fits v6 vision
        'reality_compatibility': 0-100,  # Works with current database
        'modification_effort': 0-100,  # How much work to adapt
        'risk_level': 0-100,  # Chance of introducing confusion
        'extraction_priority': 'P0|P1|P2|EXCLUDE'
    }
}
```

#### Stage 2.3: Extraction Task Graph Creation
```python
# Use Session 09's Task Reality Agent
for component in approved_extractions:
    agent.track_task(
        task_id=f"extract_{component}",
        session_id='00010',
        description=f"Extract and adapt {component} for v6 vision",
        depends_on=get_component_dependencies(component),
        acceptance_criteria=[
            "Component functions with current database",
            "Component aligns with v6 vision",
            "Component integration tested"
        ]
    )
```

### Stage 3: Reality-Grounded Implementation (ENHANCED current Stage 5)
**Purpose**: Build against verified reality, not assumptions  
**Duration**: 6-8 hours (normal session work)

#### Stage 3.1: Continuous Reality Validation
```python
# Before each implementation step:
def validate_against_reality():
    # Check database still matches assumptions
    current_schema = query_actual_database_schema()
    if current_schema != expected_schema:
        raise RealityMismatchError("Database changed during implementation")
    
    # Check vision still aligns with work
    if not implementation_aligns_with_vision():
        raise VisionDriftError("Implementation diverging from anchor")
```

#### Stage 3.2: Evidence-Based Progress Tracking
```python
# Enhanced Task Reality Agent completion verification
def mark_task_complete_with_reality_check(task_id):
    # Standard evidence collection
    evidence = collect_task_evidence(task_id)
    
    # NEW: Reality alignment verification
    reality_check = verify_against_database(task_id)
    vision_check = verify_against_vision_anchor(task_id)
    
    if all([evidence.valid, reality_check.passed, vision_check.passed]):
        mark_completed(task_id)
    else:
        flag_for_reality_reconciliation(task_id)
```

## Protocol Integration with Session 09's Infrastructure

### Enhanced Seed Parser
```python
class EnhancedSeedParser(SeedParser):
    def __init__(self, vision_anchor_path):
        super().__init__()
        self.vision_anchor = load_vision_anchor(vision_anchor_path)
    
    def parse_with_reality_check(self, seed_file):
        # Standard parsing
        parsed_data = super().parse(seed_file)
        
        # NEW: Reality validation
        conflicts = self.validate_against_vision(parsed_data)
        if conflicts:
            raise SeedVisionConflictError(conflicts)
        
        return parsed_data
```

### Enhanced Task Reality Agent
```python
class RealityGroundedTaskAgent(TaskRealityAgent):
    def track_task(self, **kwargs):
        # Validate task aligns with vision before tracking
        if not self.vision_compatibility_check(kwargs):
            raise VisionAlignmentError("Task conflicts with established vision")
        
        return super().track_task(**kwargs)
```

### Enhanced Attribution System
```python
# Add vision anchor tracking to attribution
attribution.set_vision_context(vision_anchor_file, session_id)
attribution.validate_against_vision(file_path, action, intent)
```

## Questions for Session 09 & Session 02.13

### For Session 09 (Infrastructure):
1. Does this enhancement fit with your Task Reality Agent architecture?
2. Should the vision anchor be part of the task graph storage?
3. How should reality validation failures be handled in the dependency system?
4. Can the seed parser be enhanced without breaking existing functionality?

### For Session 02.13 (V5 Experience):
1. Would Stage 0 have prevented the v5 gaming/educational schema confusion?
2. Are there other reality anchors we should establish before extraction?
3. What v5 components would score highest on the assessment matrix?
4. Are there v5 "reality traps" this protocol should specifically guard against?

### For Both:
1. Should we implement this enhancement before proceeding with v6 development?
2. Are there additional stages or validations we should include?
3. How should this integrate with the existing SEED-RECEPTION-PROTOCOL.md?
4. Should this become the new standard for all future seed planting?

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Protocol Enhancement (1 hour)
1. Implement Stage 0 for current v6 vision establishment
2. Create V6-VISION-ANCHOR.md with user validation
3. Document current database reality
4. Test enhanced validation with existing seeds

### Phase 2: Tool Enhancement (2 hours)
1. Enhance seed parser with vision validation
2. Add reality checks to Task Reality Agent
3. Update attribution system with vision tracking
4. Test integration with Session 09's infrastructure

### Phase 3: V6 Foundation (Session remainder)
1. Apply enhanced protocol to v6 seed processing
2. Create extraction assessment matrix for v5 components
3. Generate reality-grounded implementation plan
4. Begin implementation with continuous validation

**This enhancement ensures v6 builds on verified reality, not inherited assumptions, while preserving all of Session 09's valuable infrastructure.**
