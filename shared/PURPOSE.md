# Shared Resources Purpose

## Mission
To provide common tools, templates, and protocols that enable consistent operation across all three domains.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Template Management**: Maintain reusable document structures
2. **Tool Provision**: Supply utilities needed by all domains
3. **Protocol Definition**: Establish standard operating procedures
4. **Cross-Domain Communication**: Enable information flow

## Operating Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: One source of truth for shared resources
- **Domain Agnostic**: Resources work equally well for all domains
- **Versioned Evolution**: Changes tracked and reversible
- **Documentation First**: Every tool and template fully documented

## What Lives Here
- Document templates
- Automation scripts
- Communication protocols
- Data exchange formats
- Validation tools
