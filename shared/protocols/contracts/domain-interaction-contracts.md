# Domain Interaction Contracts
## Communication Standards Between Domains

### Contract Protocol

All cross-domain communication must follow this structure:

```
shared/protocols/requests/YYYY-MM-DD-{from-domain}-to-{to-domain}-{request-type}.md
shared/protocols/responses/YYYY-MM-DD-{to-domain}-to-{from-domain}-{response-type}.md
```

### Standard Contracts

#### 1. Requirements → Reality: Feasibility Check
**Request Format**:
```markdown
# Feasibility Check Request
## From: Requirements Domain
## To: Reality Domain
## Date: YYYY-MM-DD

### Requirement
[Description of what's needed]

### Constraints
[Any known limitations]

### Questions
1. Is this technically feasible?
2. What resources are required?
3. What are the risks?
4. Timeline estimate?
```

**Response Format**:
```markdown
# Feasibility Assessment Response
## From: Reality Domain
## To: Requirements Domain
## Date: YYYY-MM-DD

### Assessment: [FEASIBLE/NOT FEASIBLE/CONDITIONAL]

### Analysis
- Technical feasibility: 
- Resource requirements:
- Risk factors:
- Timeline estimate:

### Conditions (if applicable)
[What would make this feasible]

### Recommendation
[Reality Domain's advice]
```

#### 2. Reality → Reconciliation: Gap Analysis
**Request Format**:
```markdown
# Gap Analysis Request
## From: Reality Domain
## To: Reconciliation Domain

### Current State Summary
[What we actually have]

### Target State (from Requirements)
[What we need to achieve]

### Request
Please create action plan to bridge this gap.
```

#### 3. Reconciliation → Reality: Implementation Results
**Update Format**:
```markdown
# Implementation Results Update
## From: Reconciliation Domain
## To: Reality Domain

### Actions Completed
[What was actually done]

### Outcomes
[What actually happened]

### Reality Changes
[What should be updated in Reality inventory]

### New Capabilities
[What we can now do that we couldn't before]
```

### Contract Enforcement

1. **No Direct Domain Bypassing**: All communication goes through protocols
2. **Reality Veto Authority**: Reality can reject any request based on objective constraints
3. **Documentation Required**: All interactions must be documented
4. **Version Control**: All contracts are timestamped and versioned

### Emergency Protocols

In case of system-critical issues:
1. Any domain can call for emergency session
2. All domains must participate in resolution
3. Emergency decisions are temporary (24-hour limit)
4. Full review required after emergency

### Success Metrics

- **Response Time**: How quickly domains respond to requests
- **Accuracy**: How often Reality assessments prove correct
- **Completion Rate**: How often Reconciliation plans succeed
- **Communication Quality**: Clarity and usefulness of exchanges
