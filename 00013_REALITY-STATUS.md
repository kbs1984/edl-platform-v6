# 📊 REALITY STATUS DASHBOARD
**Last Updated**: Session 00013 (2025-08-16 14:35)
**Next Session**: 00014

---

## 🚨 CURRENT TRUTH (What IS, not what we think)

### Database Reality
```yaml
Status: ✅ DEPLOYED (4 tables exist)
Tables: profiles, teams, team_members, team_join_requests
Rows: 0 (empty but ready)
Migration Files: 8 created by Session 12
Last Verified: 2025-08-16 14:30 (Direct query)
```

### Version Control Reality
```yaml
Status: ⚠️ UNCOMMITTED WORK
Uncommitted: 
  - supabase/migrations/* (ALL migration files)
  - 00012_index.html (UI implementation)
  - 00012_AGENT-PROTOCOL.md (Protocol doc)
Critical: Session 12's work exists locally but NOT in git
```

### Agent Reality
```yaml
FileSystem: ✅ Operational (1.0 confidence)
GitHub: ✅ Operational (but shows uncommitted work)
Supabase: ⚠️ Shows 0 tables (permission issue, not reality)
Integration: ✅ 74% overall health
Vercel: ✅ Ready
Static Asset: ✅ Ready
Task: ⚠️ Not updated by Session 12
```

### Task Reality
```yaml
Pending: db_create_002 (but actually completed)
Not Updated: Session 12 didn't mark tasks complete
Next Priority: Commit work, then Day 2 implementation
```

## 🎯 STRATEGIC HIERARCHY FOR SESSION 14

### STRATEGY: Establish Truth-Based Development
**Why**: Build on reality, not assumptions

### OPERATIONS: Three Domains
1. **Version Control**: Secure Session 12's work
2. **Database**: Verify and test existing schema
3. **Implementation**: Continue Day 2 features

### TACTICS: Systematic Verification
1. Commit uncommitted work
2. Update task tracking
3. Test existing implementation
4. Build new features

### TASKS: Specific Actions with Agent Triggers

## 🚀 PROTOCOL v3.0 - CLAUDE CUSTOM COMMANDS (NEW!)

**Session 14 just needs ONE command to start:**
```
/project:session-start 00014
```

This automatically:
- Runs reality check
- Verifies consensus >80%
- Checks for uncommitted work
- Creates session log if missing
- BLOCKS if not ready

**Other commands available:**
- `/project:reality-status` - See this information live
- `/project:reality-check` - Full agent verification
- `/project:commit-work` - Smart git commits
- `/project:session:handoff` - Generate handoff

## ✅ SESSION 14 MANDATORY CHECKLIST (Now Automatic!)

### Phase 1: ESTABLISH TRUTH (Handled by `/project:session-start`)
The command does all this automatically - no manual steps needed!

### Phase 2: SECURE THE WORK (Next 10 minutes)
```bash
# 4. Commit Session 12's work
git add supabase/migrations/
git add 00012_index.html 
git add 00012_AGENT-PROTOCOL.md
git commit -m "Session 12: Teams-first database and UI"

# 5. Update Task Agent
python3 reality/agent-reality-auditor/task-connector/connector.py \
  --complete "db_create_002"

# 6. Verify database reality
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/00012_005_verify_deployment.sql
```

### Phase 3: BUILD ON TRUTH (Rest of session)
```bash
# 7. Test existing UI
open 00012_index.html

# 8. Continue implementation
# [Day 2 work here]

# 9. End session with status update
./scripts/00013_reality-check.sh --full
# UPDATE THIS FILE with new reality
```

| Found Uncommitted | Commit immediately | `git status && git add && git commit` |
| Database Change | Verify tables | `supabase-connector --level 2` |
| File Creation | Track file | `filesystem-connector` |
| Before Deploy | Check all | `00013_deploy-with-verification.sh` |
| Session End | Update status | Update THIS FILE |

## 📝 LESSONS FROM SESSION 13

**What Went Wrong**:
- Session 13 assumed database failure from agent report
- Didn't check multiple sources before concluding
- Created protocol but didn't follow it

**What Went Right**:
- Eventually used systematic investigation
- Found truth through multiple agents
- Discovered uncommitted work was real issue

**Key Learning**:
> "The protocol only works if it's IMPOSSIBLE to skip"

## 🚀 FOR SESSION 14

**YOU CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT**:
1. Running reality-check.sh
2. Reading this file
3. Committing Session 12's work

**Success = Following the protocol, not rushing to code**
