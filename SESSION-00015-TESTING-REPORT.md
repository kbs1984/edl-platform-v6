# Session 00015 Testing Report

## UI Testing Results

### What Works ‚úÖ
1. **Supabase Connection**: Successfully connects to https://bbrheacetxlnqbibjwsz.supabase.co
2. **Table Verification**: All 4 tables confirmed to exist (profiles, teams, team_members, team_join_requests)
3. **UI Loads**: Clean interface loads at http://localhost:8001
4. **Status Indicators**: Real-time status updates show connection state
5. **Auth Forms**: Sign in/Sign up forms render correctly

### What Needs Testing üß™
1. **User Registration**: Need to create test user via UI
2. **Team Creation**: Requires authenticated user
3. **Join Requests**: Requires multiple users
4. **RLS Policies**: Need to verify they allow expected operations

### Key Discoveries üîç
1. **Session 00012 Never Built UI**: Created elaborate plans but no implementation
2. **Claude Commands Exist**: Located in .claude/commands/ with special syntax
3. **Database Is Ready**: Tables exist, RLS is active (protecting data correctly)
4. **v5 Pattern Confirmed**: Documentation without implementation

## Testing Instructions

To test the UI yourself:
```bash
# 1. Start local server (already running on port 8001)
cd /home/b4sho/edl-projects-with-claude/edl-platform-v6
python3 -m http.server 8001

# 2. Open browser to:
http://localhost:8001

# 3. Create test account:
- Enter email: test@example.com
- Enter password: testpass123
- Click "Sign Up"

# 4. Test team creation:
- Enter team name
- Click "Create Team"
- Verify team appears in list

# 5. Test with second user:
- Sign out
- Create another account
- Try to join existing team
```

## Claude Commands Status

### Located Commands
- `~/.claude/commands/reality-status.md` - Copied from project
- `~/.claude/commands/reality-check.md` - Copied from project
- `~/.claude/commands/session-start.md` - Copied from project
- `~/.claude/commands/commit-work.md` - Copied from project
- `~/.claude/commands/update-reality.md` - Copied from project

### Testing Commands
Try running: `/project:reality-status`

If this doesn't work, the commands may need:
1. Different location (check Claude CLI docs)
2. Different format (shell scripts instead)
3. Custom runner implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test user registration through UI
2. **Priority**: Verify team creation works with auth
3. **Important**: Test Claude commands execution
4. **Future**: Add real-time updates per Session 00012 plan
