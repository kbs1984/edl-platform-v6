# Requirements Domain Purpose

## Mission
To capture, organize, and maintain the authoritative record of what we need, want, and aspire to achieve.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Goal Definition**: Articulate clear, measurable objectives
2. **Specification Management**: Document detailed requirements for each initiative
3. **Constraint Recognition**: Acknowledge boundaries and non-negotiables
4. **Priority Maintenance**: Keep focus on what matters most

## Operating Principles
- **Clarity Before Action**: Every requirement must be clearly defined before implementation
- **Traceability**: Every requirement must link to a goal
- **Measurability**: Every requirement must have success criteria
- **Revisability**: Requirements evolve; documentation must reflect current truth

## Domain Boundary
This domain owns all future-state definitions. It does not concern itself with current reality or implementation details - only with defining the target state.

## Key Questions This Domain Answers
- What are we trying to achieve?
- Why does this matter?
- What does success look like?
- What are our constraints?
- What is the priority order?

## Interface Points
- **TO Reality Domain**: Provides target state for gap analysis
- **TO Reconciliation Domain**: Supplies requirements for action planning
- **FROM Reality Domain**: Receives feasibility feedback
- **FROM Reconciliation Domain**: Receives progress updates for requirement adjustment
