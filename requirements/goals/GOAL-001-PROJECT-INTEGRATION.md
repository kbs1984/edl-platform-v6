# GOAL-001: Project Integration
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: 2025-08-14 | Session #00001  
**Status**: Defined  

## Objective
Create comprehensive integration between the Personal Operating System and all existing projects in the edl-projects-with-claude directory.

## Success Criteria
1. **Project Registry Populated**: All existing projects catalogued in reality/project-registry/
2. **Integration Links Established**: Clear navigation paths from POS to legacy projects
3. **Asset Extraction Completed**: Valuable components identified and linked/imported
4. **Knowledge Preservation**: Key learnings from past projects documented
5. **Access Patterns Defined**: Standard ways to reference and utilize past work

## Rationale
Brian's stated objective: "link to all other projects that I worked on in the past" while "extracting what I was able to benefit from in the past but with a stable system that doesn't accumulate technical debt."

## Constraints
- Must not modify existing projects directly
- Must maintain constitutional governance 
- Must follow three-domain architecture
- Must prevent technical debt accumulation in POS

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Cataloguing all existing projects
- Creating reference links and documentation
- Extracting reusable patterns and learnings
- Building navigation system for past projects
- Documenting integration patterns

### Out of Scope
- Modifying existing project code
- Migrating entire codebases into POS
- Fixing technical debt in legacy projects
- Merging inconsistent architectures

## Dependencies
- Reality Domain audit of existing projects
- Project registry structure creation
- Navigation system design

## Metrics
- Number of projects catalogued: Target = All discovered projects
- Integration completeness: Target = 100% of valuable assets identified
- Access time reduction: Target = <30 seconds to find any past project asset
- Knowledge extraction: Target = Key patterns documented from each project

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk**: Integration complexity overwhelming system
- **Mitigation**: Incremental approach, one project at a time
- **Risk**: Technical debt infiltration
- **Mitigation**: Strict constitutional enforcement, Reality Domain oversight

## Related Requirements
- TBD (this is our first requirement)

## Acceptance Tests
1. Can navigate from POS to any past project in under 30 seconds
2. Can identify which past project contains specific capabilities
3. Can extract learnings without importing technical debt
4. Integration documented and searchable
5. Reality Domain confirms accurate project state representation
