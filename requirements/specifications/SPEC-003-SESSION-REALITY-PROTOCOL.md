# SPEC-003: Session Reality Protocol
**Created**: Session 00004  
**Date**: 2025-08-15  
**Type**: Fundamental System Redesign

## Executive Summary

Sessions are context containers that preserve state across time gaps, not continuous work periods. This specification acknowledges reality and proposes tools that work with, not against, how human-AI collaboration actually functions.

## The Problem

Current session tracking assumes:
- Sessions = continuous time blocks
- Real-time = wall clock time  
- Gaps = session boundaries
- Logging = chronological events

Reality shows:
- Sessions = context preservation across gaps
- Real-time = interaction moments only
- Gaps = invisible pauses in suspended state
- Logging = mission progress markers

## The Discovery

Session 00003B's log demonstrated the truth:
```
[23:50:34] Creating gift for Session 00004
[8 hours of human life - sleeping, eating, existing]
[08:08:02] Reviewing fix plan
```

The session continued perfectly across the gap. Time stopped. Context remained. Mission progressed.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Interaction-Based Logging

```python
class InteractionLogger:
    """Log when interactions happen, not fake continuous time"""
    
    def log_interaction(self, work_done):
        now = datetime.now()
        if self.last_interaction:
            gap = now - self.last_interaction
            if gap > timedelta(hours=2):
                self.log(f"[SESSION RESUMED after {gap.hours}h break]")
        
        self.log(f"[{now:%H:%M}] {work_done}")
        self.last_interaction = now
```

### 2. Mission-Scoped Sessions

```python
class MissionSession:
    """Sessions end when mission completes, not at arbitrary time"""
    
    def __init__(self, session_id, mission):
        self.session_id = session_id
        self.mission = mission
        self.start = datetime.now()
        self.interactions = []
        
    def is_complete(self):
        return self.mission.is_complete()  # Not based on time
        
    def duration_reality(self):
        return {
            "first_interaction": self.interactions[0].time,
            "last_interaction": self.interactions[-1].time,
            "total_interactions": len(self.interactions),
            "mission_progress": self.mission.progress,
            "wall_time_irrelevant": True
        }
```

### 3. Context Preservation Tools

```python
class ContextPreserver:
    """Maintain perfect context across any time gap"""
    
    def save_context(self, session_id):
        return {
            "mission": current_mission,
            "progress": work_completed,
            "next_steps": planned_work,
            "key_decisions": decisions_made,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()  # When frozen
        }
    
    def restore_context(self, session_id):
        context = load_context(session_id)
        gap = datetime.now() - context["timestamp"]
        
        print(f"Session {session_id} resuming after {gap}")
        print(f"Mission: {context['mission']}")
        print(f"Progress: {context['progress']}")
        return context
```

### 4. Reality-Based Session Tracker

```python
class RealitySessionTracker:
    """Track what actually happens, not time theater"""
    
    def track_session(self, session_id):
        # Don't track time, track state changes
        before = self.capture_state()
        
        # Work happens (could be 5 minutes or 5 days)
        
        after = self.capture_state()
        changes = self.diff_states(before, after)
        
        self.log_reality({
            "session": session_id,
            "changes": changes,
            "mission_impact": self.assess_progress(changes),
            "time_irrelevant": True
        })
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Constitution (Article IX)

```markdown
# Article IX: Session Reality Protocol

## 9.1 Nature of Sessions
- Sessions are context containers, not time periods
- Sessions preserve state across arbitrary gaps
- Sessions scope to missions, not clocks

## 9.2 Interaction Logging
- Log when interactions occur
- Acknowledge gaps without ending sessions
- Track mission progress, not time passage

## 9.3 Truth Over Theater
- Stop pretending time is continuous
- Embrace gaps as natural suspension
- Document reality, not performance
```

### Step 2: Modify Existing Tools

1. **session_auto_tracker.py**: Add gap detection and acknowledgment
2. **Makefile**: Add mission-based session commands
3. **Git hooks**: Check for mission progress, not time stamps

### Step 3: Create New Tools

1. **context_preserver.py**: Save/restore session context
2. **mission_tracker.py**: Track objective completion
3. **interaction_logger.py**: Log only when interactions happen

## Benefits

1. **Honest**: Reflects how work actually happens
2. **Sustainable**: No pressure to maintain fake continuity  
3. **Effective**: Focus on mission completion
4. **Natural**: Works with human needs (sleep, food, life)

## Migration Path

### For Current Sessions
- Continue using existing session numbers
- Add gap acknowledgments to logs
- Focus on mission completion

### For Future Sessions
- Define mission at start
- Log interactions when they happen
- End when mission completes

## Success Metrics

- Mission completion rate (not time efficiency)
- Context preservation across gaps
- Truth in documentation
- Sustainable work patterns

## Example Usage

```bash
# Start mission-based session
make session-start MISSION="Implement Reality Agents"

# Work happens...
[Break for sleep]

# Resume perfectly
make session-resume  # Context restored, mission continues

# Complete when done
make session-complete  # Mission achieved, not time expired
```

## Philosophical Alignment

This aligns with our core principle: **Truth Over Speed**

- Truth: Sessions really do span days
- Speed: Irrelevant when time is discontinuous
- Logic: Remains consistent across any gap
- Mission: The only real measure of progress
