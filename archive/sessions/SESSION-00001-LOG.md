# Session #00001 Log
**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Type**: CLI Session  
**Participant**: Brian Kim  
**Platform**: Claude Code CLI  

## Session Declaration
"Good morning. This is the very first session for this project and my name is Brian Kim. We'll call this session #00001."

## Session Objectives
Create a Personal Operating System that:
1. Links to all other past projects
2. Starts fresh while extracting benefits from previous work
3. Maintains stability without accumulating technical debt
4. Implements three-domain architecture (Requirements, Reality, Reconciliation)

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Three-Domain Architecture Adopted
- **Requirements**: What I need
- **Reality**: What I have  
- **Reconciliation**: How to get it
- Rationale: Prevents building without understanding, creates systematic progress

### 2. Reality Domain Established as Leader
- Reality Domain has veto power over other domains
- Rationale: "Truth is non-negotiable" - prevents building on false assumptions
- Reality Domain Manager becomes Chief Truth Officer

### 3. Directory Map Constitution Ratified
- Formal governance for directory structure
- No ad-hoc changes permitted
- Change requests require documentation and approval
- Version 1.1.0 ratified

### 4. Session Protocol Established
- CLI sessions: Numbered (#00001, #00002, etc.)
- Desktop sessions: Unnamed, stored in cloud
- Clear distinction seared into foundation

## Work Completed

### Documents Created
1. `DIRECTORY-MAP-CONSTITUTION.md` - Governance framework (v1.1.0)
2. `SESSION-PROTOCOL.md` - CLI vs Desktop distinction
3. `SYSTEM-INDEX.md` - Master navigation and status
4. Purpose files for all domains
5. This session log

### Directory Structure Implemented
```
/edl-platform-v6/
├── requirements/
├── reality/
├── reconciliation/
├── shared/
└── archive/
```

## Technical Implementation
- Used MCP session management tools
- Tracked progress with TodoWrite
- Created 10+ foundational documents
- Established clear navigation structure

## Key Insights Captured
1. "A requirement undefined is a failure predefined"
2. "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away" - PKD
3. "The gap is not the enemy; it is the opportunity"
4. "A session without a number is Desktop. A session with a number is CLI."

## Open Items for Next Session
1. Create domain index files (REQUIREMENTS_INDEX.md, etc.)
2. Initialize agent brigade structure
3. Create project registry to link past projects
4. Set up Reality Domain inventory of existing projects

## Session Metrics
- Duration: In progress
- Files Created: 10
- Directories Created: 15
- Decisions Documented: 4
- Constitution Version: 1.1.0

## Brian's Vision Statement
"I would like to create a Personal Operating System in this directory that will link to all other projects that I worked on in the past. My aim is to start afresh while extracting what I was able to benefit from in the past but with a stable system that doesn't accumulate technical debt."

## Reality Check Notes
- Previous projects identified: edl-platform-v5, edl-claude-cod3-v4, and others
- Clean directory start (no existing files)
- Clear separation from past technical debt
