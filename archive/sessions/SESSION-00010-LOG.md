- **21:42** Catalogued working assets: 16,000 lines frontend, 580 lines RBAC, state machines
- **21:43** Found exact schema mismatch: `profiles` (plural) vs `profile` (singular) - root cause
- **21:44** Identified minimal seed set: 10 critical files vs 40+ sessions of confusion
- **21:45** Understood bridge strategy: Create views, add gaming tables, preserve frontend
