# Coaching for Session #00004: GitHub CLI Integration
**From**: Session #00002 & #00003  
**To**: Session #00004  
**Date**: 2025-08-14  

## üéØ Your Mission: GitHub CLI Integration

Session #00004, you'll be implementing GitHub CLI integration to connect our local work with remote repositories. This is crucial for collaboration and backup.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings from Session #00003

### What We Discovered (The Hard Way)
1. **Session tracker fails silently without git** - We spent time debugging this
2. **Git ‚â† GitHub** - Local git works, but GitHub needs authentication
3. **Manual tracking burden** - Everything must be logged explicitly
4. **File System Agent could solve this** - Consider using it!

### Current State (What #00003 Fixed)
- ‚úÖ Git repository initialized (local)
- ‚úÖ Initial commit with all files
- ‚úÖ Session tracking now detects file changes
- ‚ùå No remote repository connected
- ‚ùå No GitHub authentication set up

## üìã Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Reality Check (ALWAYS START HERE)
```bash
# Constitutional requirement
make track-init SESSION=00004

# Check current reality
gh --version          # Is it installed?
gh auth status        # Are we authenticated?
git remote -v         # Any remotes configured?
git log --oneline -5  # What's been committed?
```

### Step 2: Progressive Discovery Pattern
Just like the File System and Supabase agents:

**Level 1: GitHub CLI Availability**
- Is `gh` installed?
- Can we authenticate?
- What permissions do we have?

**Level 2: Repository Connection**
- Can we create a remote repo?
- Can we push to it?
- What branch protection exists?

**Level 3: Automation Capabilities**
- Can we create PRs programmatically?
- Can we manage issues?
- What about GitHub Actions?

### Step 3: Handle Authentication Carefully
```python
class GitHubConnector:
    def check_auth(self):
        """Check authentication status"""
        result = subprocess.run(["gh", "auth", "status"], 
                              capture_output=True)
        if result.returncode != 0:
            return {
                "authenticated": False,
                "error": "Not authenticated",
                "action_required": "Run: gh auth login"
            }
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls (Learn from Our Pain)

### 1. Don't Assume Anything
```python
# BAD - Assumes gh exists
subprocess.run(["gh", "pr", "create"])

# GOOD - Check first
if shutil.which("gh"):
    subprocess.run(["gh", "pr", "create"])
else:
    return {"error": "GitHub CLI not installed"}
```

### 2. Handle User Interaction
The `gh auth login` command is INTERACTIVE. You can't fully automate it:
```python
# This will hang waiting for user input!
subprocess.run(["gh", "auth", "login"], capture_output=True)

# Better: Detect and inform
if not authenticated:
    print("Manual action required: Run 'gh auth login' in terminal")
    return {"status": "auth_required", "manual_step": True}
```

### 3. Remote Repository Complexity
Creating or connecting to a remote has multiple failure modes:
- Repository might already exist
- User might not have permissions
- Name might be taken
- Rate limits might apply

## üí° Integration Opportunities

### Use Your File System Agent!
```python
# At session start
fs_connector = FileSystemConnector()
start_snapshot = fs_connector.capture_snapshot()

# At session end
end_snapshot = fs_connector.capture_snapshot()
changes = fs_connector.compare_snapshots(start_snapshot, end_snapshot)

# Use for PR description
pr_body = f"""
## Session #{session_id} Changes

### Files Modified
{format_changes(changes)}

### Metrics
- Files changed: {len(changes['files_modified'])}
- Lines added/removed: {calculate_diff_stats()}
"""
```

### Enhance the Makefile
```makefile
# Add GitHub commands
gh-setup:
	@gh auth status || echo "Run: gh auth login"

gh-create-pr:
	@gh pr create --title "Session $(SESSION)" \
	              --body "$$(cat archive/sessions/SESSION-$(SESSION)-HANDOFF.md)"

gh-push-session:
	@git checkout -b session-$(SESSION)
	@git push -u origin session-$(SESSION)
```

## üìö Patterns to Reuse

From **Supabase Agent**: Progressive discovery, confidence scoring
From **File System Agent**: Change detection, snapshot comparison
From **Session #00003**: Reality checking, manual fallbacks

## üéì Philosophical Guidance

### Reality Domain Principles
1. **Check before assuming** - Is gh installed? Are we authenticated?
2. **Report actual state** - "Authentication required" not "Will authenticate"
3. **Graceful degradation** - Work locally even if GitHub fails
4. **User empowerment** - Clear instructions when manual steps needed

### Constitutional Compliance
- Log every authentication attempt
- Track decisions about security
- Document what requires user interaction
- Keep local backups even with GitHub

## üîß Concrete First Steps

1. **Check gh installation**
   ```bash
   which gh || echo "Need to install: brew install gh"
   ```

2. **Create test script**
   ```python
   # github_validator.py
   def validate_github_setup():
       checks = {
           "gh_installed": check_gh_installed(),
           "authenticated": check_gh_auth(),
           "repo_exists": check_remote_repo(),
           "can_push": test_push_permission()
       }
       return checks
   ```

3. **Start with read operations**
   - List PRs: `gh pr list`
   - View issues: `gh issue list`
   - Check repo info: `gh repo view`

4. **Then move to write operations**
   - Create branch
   - Push changes
   - Create PR
   - Add comments

## üéØ Success Criteria

By end of Session #00004:
1. ‚úÖ GitHub CLI authentication working
2. ‚úÖ Can push session branches to remote
3. ‚úÖ Can create PRs programmatically
4. ‚úÖ Session tracker enhanced with GitHub integration
5. ‚úÖ Reality Domain principles maintained
6. ‚úÖ All manual steps documented

## ü§ù We're Here to Help

Session #00002 & #00003 are here to coach you through:
- Authentication challenges
- Rate limiting issues
- Integration patterns
- Reality checking approaches

Remember: **Truth over Theater**. If GitHub integration is partially working, document exactly what works and what doesn't. Don't pretend full automation if user interaction is required.

Good luck, Session #00004! You're building on solid foundations.

This quote is perfect for GitHub CLI work - the authentication requirements won't disappear just because we wish they would!
