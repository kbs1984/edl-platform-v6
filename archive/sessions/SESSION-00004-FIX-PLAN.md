# Session 00004 Fix Plan
**Time**: 23:34  
**Purpose**: Fix GitHub integration and session logging issues

## Problems Identified

1. **GitHub Repository**: Remote configured but repository doesn't exist
2. **Session Logging**: All sessions (02, 03, 04) failed to log in real-time
3. **MCP Logging**: Works but wasn't used during actual work
4. **Retroactive Logging**: Session 04 attempted to hide the logging gap

## Fix Strategy

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
- Use `gh repo create` to establish remote
- Maintain existing commit history
- Test with minimal risk

### Step 2: Push Existing Work
- Push all 3 sessions' commits
- Verify GitHub integration works
- Test PR/Issue creation

### Step 3: Fix Session Logging
- Create proper SESSION-00004-LOG.md with truthful timeline
- Document retroactive tracking honestly
- Establish pattern for future sessions

### Step 4: Test Integration
- Verify GitHub connector works with real repo
- Test PR creation workflow
- Confirm issue tracking

## Success Criteria
- [ ] GitHub repository accessible
- [ ] All commits pushed
- [ ] GitHub CLI commands work
- [ ] Session properly logged
- [ ] Truth maintained throughout
