# Archive Purpose

## Mission
To preserve historical records and completed cycles while keeping active domains clean and focused.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Session Preservation**: Store completed session logs
2. **Version History**: Maintain previous iterations of important documents
3. **Decision Records**: Keep rationale for major changes
4. **Learning Repository**: Extract and store lessons learned

## Operating Principles
- **Write Once**: Archived items are immutable
- **Indexed Access**: Everything findable through metadata
- **Time-Stamped**: All entries include temporal context
- **Compressed Storage**: Optimize space while maintaining accessibility

## Archival Rules
1. Items move to archive only when fully completed
2. Archived items never return to active domains
3. Each archived item must have metadata (date, session, reason)
4. Quarterly review for permanent deletion decisions
