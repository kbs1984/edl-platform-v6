# Session 00015 Protocol Violation Incident Report

**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Time**: 17:59 UTC  
**Severity**: High - Protocol Breach with Cascading Failures

## Incident Summary

Session 00015 successfully identified and documented a critical schema discrepancy, but then violated our established SUPABASE-SQL-PROTOCOL.md while attempting fixes, leading to authentication failures.

## What Went Wrong

### 1. Protocol Violations
- **Failed to follow pre-flight checklist** from SUPABASE-SQL-PROTOCOL.md
- **Didn't reference 00012_001_teams_first_v2.sql** success pattern
- **Added database trigger without proper RLS design**
- **Made sporadic fixes instead of comprehensive planning**

### 2. Specific Failures
- Created `users` table with RLS enabled but no proper policies
- Added trigger that can't insert due to RLS restrictions
- Multiple quick-fix attempts instead of systematic approach
- Ignored established patterns from Session 00012

### 3. Current Broken State
- Auth signup fails with "Database error saving new user"
- Email validation errors suggesting RLS/trigger conflicts
- Multiple partial migrations without proper verification
- System in unstable state despite "successful" migration

## Root Cause Analysis

### Immediate Cause
Database trigger `create_user_on_signup()` cannot insert into `users` table due to RLS policies not designed for trigger context.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Context Switch**: Discovered schema issue, immediately jumped to fixes
2. **Protocol Abandonment**: Didn't follow SUPABASE-SQL-PROTOCOL.md checklist
3. **Pattern Ignorance**: Didn't study Session 00012 success patterns
4. **Assumption Cascade**: Added complexity without understanding base requirements

### Systemic Issue
**The same pattern that caused the original schema discrepancy** - building without understanding context - was repeated in the fix attempt.

## Impact Assessment

### What's Broken
- User registration completely non-functional
- Database in partially migrated state
- Multiple incomplete migrations applied
- Trust in migration process compromised

### What Still Works
- Existing database structure from Session 00012
- Basic Supabase connection
- Static UI deployment
- Documentation and logging systems

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Protocol Exists For A Reason
The SUPABASE-SQL-PROTOCOL.md wasn't followed because of urgency to "fix quickly" - exactly the same mindset that created the original problem.

### 2. Reference Implementations Matter
Session 00012's `00012_001_teams_first_v2.sql` shows the correct RLS patterns. Should have studied this FIRST.

### 3. Incremental Fixes Create Technical Debt
Multiple small migrations (`00015_001`, `00015_002`, `00015_003`) instead of one comprehensive fix.

## Recovery Options

### Option A: Proper RLS Design (Recommended)
1. Study `00012_001_teams_first_v2.sql` RLS patterns
2. Design proper `users` table policies following protocol
3. Create single comprehensive migration fixing all issues
4. Follow verification protocol completely

### Option B: Rollback and Restart (Nuclear)
1. Drop all Session 00015 migrations
2. Return to Session 00012 clean state
3. Restart with proper protocol compliance
4. Re-implement users table with full RLS design

## Recommendation

**Option A** - We can recover by following our protocol properly. The fundamental schema fix (adding users table) was correct, we just implemented the RLS policies incorrectly.

## Prevention Measures

1. **MANDATORY**: Read SUPABASE-SQL-PROTOCOL.md before ANY database work
2. **MANDATORY**: Reference successful patterns before creating new ones
3. **NO QUICK FIXES**: Always design comprehensively, implement once
4. **VERIFICATION FIRST**: Test RLS policies before deploying triggers

## Status

**INCIDENT OPEN** - Auth system non-functional, requires immediate protocol-compliant fix.

---

**Truth Statement**: Session 00015 violated its own principles about building with context. We identified the problem correctly but fixed it incorrectly by abandoning established protocols.
