## Key Metrics
| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Requirements Defined | 0 | TBD | 🔴 |
| Reality Documented | 0% | 100% | 🔴 |
| Gaps Identified | 0 | N/A | 🔴 |
| Actions Completed | 0 | TBD | 🔴 |

## System Principles
1. **Requirements before Reality** - Know what you want before assessing what you have
2. **Reality before Reconciliation** - Honest assessment before action planning
3. **Document before Doing** - Capture intent before execution
4. **Complete before Continuing** - Finish one cycle before starting another

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Navigate to domain
cd requirements/  # or reality/ or reconciliation/

# Check domain status
cat requirements/REQUIREMENTS_INDEX.md

# View constitution
cat DIRECTORY-MAP-CONSTITUTION.md

# Check system health
cat SYSTEM-INDEX.md
```

## Domain Communication Protocol
All cross-domain communication follows this pattern:
1. Source domain creates request in `shared/protocols/requests/`
2. Target domain processes and responds in `shared/protocols/responses/`
3. Reconciliation domain logs interaction in `reconciliation/progress-tracking/`
