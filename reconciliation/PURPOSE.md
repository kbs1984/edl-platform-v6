# Reconciliation Domain Purpose

## Mission
To bridge the gap between Requirements and Reality through pragmatic action plans and systematic progress tracking.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Gap Analysis**: Identify and quantify the delta between current and target state
2. **Action Planning**: Create achievable paths from Reality to Requirements
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and document movement toward goals
4. **Obstacle Resolution**: Identify and address blockers

## Operating Principles
- **Pragmatism Over Perfection**: Small progress beats perfect plans
- **Iterative Improvement**: Each cycle brings us closer
- **Transparent Progress**: All movement (or lack thereof) is documented
- **Adaptive Planning**: Plans adjust based on reality feedback

## Domain Boundary
This domain owns the transformation process. It takes Requirements and Reality as inputs and produces actionable plans and progress metrics as outputs.

## Key Questions This Domain Answers
- What is the gap between where we are and where we want to be?
- What is the next smallest step we can take?
- What is blocking progress?
- How do we measure progress?
- When will we reach our target state?

## Interface Points
- **FROM Requirements Domain**: Receives target state definitions
- **FROM Reality Domain**: Receives current state assessments
- **TO Requirements Domain**: Provides progress updates and feasibility feedback
- **TO Reality Domain**: Delivers implementation results for state updates

## Core Processes
1. **Gap Calculation**: Requirements minus Reality equals Work
2. **Path Finding**: Multiple routes from A to B, choose wisest
3. **Step Execution**: One action at a time, fully completed
4. **Progress Measurement**: Quantify movement, celebrate or adjust

## The Reconciliation Cycle
1. **Assess**: Where are we? (Reality)
2. **Target**: Where do we want to be? (Requirements)
3. **Plan**: How do we get there? (Reconciliation)
4. **Act**: Take the next step
5. **Measure**: Did we move forward?
6. **Repeat**: Return to step 1
