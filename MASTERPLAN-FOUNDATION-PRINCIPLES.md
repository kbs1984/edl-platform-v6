# Masterplan Foundation Principles
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Created**: Session 00014  
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Purpose**: Constitutional axioms for all EDL Truth Operating System masterplans

---

## Core Axioms

### 1. Reality is the Ultimate Authority
- What IS supersedes what we THINK is
- Multiple sources of truth must reconcile
- Conflicts require investigation, not assumption
- Evidence hierarchy: Direct Query > Agent Report > Cache > Memory

### 2. Every Assumption Must Be Verifiable
- No decision without data
- All beliefs must be testable
- Uncertainty must be quantified (confidence scores)
- Assumptions must be documented and tracked

### 3. Failure is Data, Not Disaster
- Every failure must generate learnings
- Failures must be logged, not hidden
- Recovery is more important than prevention
- Post-mortems are mandatory, blame is prohibited

### 4. Automation Serves Human Intent
- Humans set goals, systems execute
- Every automation must be overrideable
- Transparency over magic
- Explain decisions, don't just execute

### 5. Visibility Prevents Surprises
- All state changes must be observable
- Metrics must be real-time when possible
- Alerts must be actionable
- Dashboards must tell stories, not just display data

---

## Design Constraints

### 1. Scope Constraint
- No plan exceeds what can be built in 2 sessions
- Each phase must deliver working value
- Complexity must be incrementally added
- Perfect is the enemy of good

### 2. Testability Constraint
- Every component must be testable in isolation
- Integration tests must cover critical paths
- Test data must represent real scenarios
- Failure modes must be simulated

### 3. Dependency Constraint
- Dependencies must be explicit and minimal
- Circular dependencies are prohibited
- External dependencies must be abstracted
- Version compatibility must be tracked

### 4. Human Override Constraint
- Human intervention must always be possible
- Emergency stops must exist for all automations
- Manual mode must be available
- Audit trails must track all overrides

### 5. Recovery Constraint
- State must be recoverable from any failure
- Backups must be automatic and tested
- Rollback procedures must be documented
- Data loss must be quantifiable

---

## Integration Requirements

### 1. Health Metrics Exposure
- All systems must expose `/health` endpoint
- Health must include: status, confidence, last_check
- Degraded states must be distinguishable from failures
- Health checks must not impact performance

### 2. Action Traceability
- Every action must be logged
- Logs must include: who, what, when, why
- Session attribution must be maintained
- Correlation IDs must link related actions

### 3. Communication Protocol
- Inter-system communication uses JSON
- Async operations use event streams
- Sync operations use REST patterns
- Message schemas must be versioned

### 4. Performance Impact
- Monitoring overhead must be <5% CPU
- Storage growth must be predictable
- Network traffic must be optimized
- Cache invalidation must be explicit

### 5. Security Baseline
- No credentials in code or logs
- All data transmission encrypted
- Access control must be role-based
- Audit logs must be immutable

---

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Gradual Rollout Pattern
```
Alpha (Session N) → Beta (Session N+1) → GA (Session N+2)
- Alpha: Core functionality, happy path
- Beta: Error handling, edge cases  
- GA: Performance optimization, polish
```

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern
```
Try → Fail → Retry → Fail → Circuit Open → Fallback
- Max retries: 3
- Backoff: Exponential
- Circuit reset: After timeout
- Fallback: Cached or degraded
```

### 3. Observer Pattern
```
Event → Publish → Subscribe → React
- Events are immutable
- Subscribers are decoupled
- Reactions are async
- Failures don't cascade
```

### 4. Repository Pattern
```
Data → Repository → Cache → Consumer
- Single source of truth
- Cache for performance
- Invalidation on write
- Consistency over speed
```

## Success Metrics Framework

### 1. Reliability Metrics
- **Uptime**: >99.9% for critical paths
- **MTTR**: <10 minutes for P0 issues
- **Error Rate**: <1% for user operations
- **Consistency**: >95% agent consensus

### 2. Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: <1s for queries
- **Processing Time**: <30s for reality checks
- **Throughput**: >100 operations/minute
- **Resource Usage**: <20% idle CPU

### 3. Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for critical paths
- **Documentation**: 100% for public APIs
- **Code Review**: 100% for core changes
- **Technical Debt**: <10% of codebase

### 4. Productivity Metrics
- **Deployment Frequency**: Daily
- **Lead Time**: <1 hour
- **Change Failure Rate**: <5%
- **Session Efficiency**: >70%

## Risk Framework

### 1. Risk Categories
- **Critical**: System unavailable
- **High**: Major feature broken
- **Medium**: Performance degraded
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues

### 2. Mitigation Strategies
- **Prevent**: Design out the risk
- **Reduce**: Minimize probability
- **Transfer**: Use external service
- **Accept**: Document and monitor

### 3. Escalation Path
```
Detection → Alert → Triage → Response → Resolution → Review
- Detection: <1 minute
- Alert: <2 minutes
- Triage: <5 minutes
- Response: <10 minutes
- Resolution: Per SLA
- Review: Within 24 hours
```

## Evolution Principles

### 1. Backward Compatibility
- Breaking changes require migration path
- Deprecation notices: 2 sessions minimum
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Rollback always possible

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality works everywhere
- Advanced features gracefully degrade
- New capabilities don't break old ones
- Optional complexity

### 3. Documentation First
- Design docs before implementation
- API docs before coding
- User docs before release
- Update docs with code

### 4. Continuous Learning
- Every session generates insights
- Patterns become protocols
- Protocols become automation
- Automation becomes intelligence

## Compliance Checklist

Every masterplan must:
- [ ] Reference these principles
- [ ] Define clear success metrics
- [ ] Include rollback procedures
- [ ] Specify monitoring points
- [ ] Document assumptions
- [ ] Identify dependencies
- [ ] Estimate effort
- [ ] Define handoff criteria
- [ ] Include test strategy
- [ ] Address security concerns

---

## Amendment Process

Changes to these principles require:
1. Proposal in session log
2. Evidence of need
3. Impact analysis
4. Migration strategy
5. Consensus from system
6. Documentation update
7. Announcement in handoff

*These principles are living guidelines that evolve with our understanding of truth.*
