## Limitations Recognition

### Time Constraints
- Single session focus (one at a time)
- Sequential processing required
- No parallel CLI sessions

### Resource Constraints
- Limited to local file system
- No external API access (except web tools)
- Cannot access Desktop session memory

### Knowledge Gaps
- Full scope of all past projects not yet inventoried
- Specific integration requirements undefined
- Success metrics not yet established

## Ground Truth Summary

**We HAVE**:
- Clean directory structure
- Constitutional governance
- Clear session protocols
- Access to past project files
- Established domain hierarchy

**We LACK**:
- Active agents
- Project integration links
- Defined requirements
- Success metrics
- Reconciliation plans

**We CAN**:
- Build systematically
- Document thoroughly
- Maintain truth
- Prevent debt accumulation

**We CANNOT**:
- Access Desktop memory
- Modify past directly
- Work without session numbers
- Bypass Reality checks
