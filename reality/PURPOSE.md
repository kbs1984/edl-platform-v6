# Reality Domain Purpose

## Mission
To maintain an honest, comprehensive inventory of what exists, what works, and what constraints we face.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Asset Inventory**: Catalog all existing projects, tools, and resources
2. **Capability Assessment**: Document what we can actually do
3. **Limitation Recognition**: Honestly acknowledge what we cannot do
4. **State Monitoring**: Track current system state and health

## Operating Principles
- **Truth Over Comfort**: Document reality as it is, not as we wish it were
- **Evidence-Based**: Every assertion must be verifiable
- **Currency**: Information must be current and regularly validated
- **Completeness**: Better to know an uncomfortable truth than miss it

## Domain Boundary
This domain owns all current-state documentation. It focuses exclusively on what IS, not what SHOULD BE or what COULD BE.

## Key Questions This Domain Answers
- What do we actually have?
- What is currently working?
- What is broken or degraded?
- What are our real capabilities?
- What are our actual constraints?

## Interface Points
- **TO Requirements Domain**: Provides feasibility reality checks
- **TO Reconciliation Domain**: Supplies current state for gap analysis
- **FROM Requirements Domain**: Receives target state for comparison
- **FROM Reconciliation Domain**: Receives implementation results for state updates

## Sacred Duties
1. **The Daily Reality Check**: Verify critical system state
2. **The Weekly Inventory**: Update project and resource status
3. **The Monthly Audit**: Comprehensive capability assessment
